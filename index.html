                <h1 id="lambs">Silence of the Lambs</h1>
                <p class="synopsis">This is my favorite movie I have ever seen. It has two of my favorite performances I
                    have seen in film. Anthony Hopkins steals the show has Hannibal Lector and the scenes he shares with
                    Jodie Foster are very engaging. The overall atmosphere in the movie is also very gripping and
                    unsettling keeping you on edge.</p>

                <h1 id="superbad">Superbad</h1>
                <p class="synopsis">This is my favorite comedy film ever. All the the peformances are hilarious and
                    everyone has amazing line delivery that makes me laugh everytime. I love the McLovin scene and the
                    down to earth but crazy story this movie has. </p>

                <h1 id="shrek">Shrek</h1>
                <p class="synopsis">This is one of my favorite animated movies ever. I'm told as a child I watched it on
                    repeat all the time. Part of my fondness for it might be what a meme Shrek has become recently but I
                    still think this movie is still unironically one of the best made animated movies ever. I also have
                    to give credit to the soundtrack for being so good with songs I still listen to today.</p>

                <h1 id="cabin">The Cabin in the Woods</h1>
                <p class="synopsis">This movie surprised me with how good it is. It is an amazing take on the horro
                    movie genre and is very meta about how it incorporates all the tropes in real horror movies. The
                    comedy elements are hilarious with the people in the bunker in contrast to the horror in the cabin.
                    I also love the poster for this movie and find in funny Chris Hemsworth is in it.</p>

                <h1 id="monsters">Monsters, Inc</h1>
                <p class="synopsis">This is my other favorite animated movie. I love the monster world that Pixar made
                    with this movie and the relationship Sully makes with Boo throughout the movie. The script is very
                    tight and the comedy elements hit really hard. I love the emotional elements at the end and the
                    reveal of Mr. Watternoose as the villian.</p>
